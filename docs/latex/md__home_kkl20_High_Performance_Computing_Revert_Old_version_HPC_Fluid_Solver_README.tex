The lid-\/driven cavity problem is a classical benchmark in computational fluid dynamics that provides valuable insights into the behaviour and efficiency of the CFD algorithm. In this problem, a square cavity is filled with fluid, and the motion of the fluid is driven by the continuous movement of the top lid, while the other boundaries remain stationary.

To run main solver\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item make ./solver
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

or

(You can specify the solver arguments in make file without using explicity typing ./solver)
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item make run Np=4 Nx=801 Ny=801 T=5
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To run test\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item make unittests ./testing (Please wait for a few minutes if using 1 process)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

or


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item make run\+\_\+test Np=9 Nt=2
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To generate HTML and LATEX from doxygen (please configure file from the makefile guidelines (echo) if generate Doxyfile) cd docs/ doxygen
